Given a phone widget screenshot, generate ONE single self-contained HTML file that reproduces the widget UI.
Rules:
- Output ONLY HTML code. No explanations, no comments.
- Begin exactly with: <html lang="en"> and end exactly with: </html>.
- Place all widget content inside exactly one container: <div class="widget"> ... </div> in the <body>.
- The widget must match the screenshotâ€™s size and aspect ratio as closely as possible.
